The code in st-signals-app is for Android devices 2.2 but should run on devices 1.5 and up.
If you want to test the could look for the .apk in the bin folder. This apk is not signed so you will need to enable "Unknown Sources" in your phones settings.

It can be installed using ADB or and application such as Astro File manager.

==Usage==
*If opening for the first time a Settings window will be show.
*Once settings saved you will be shown the main screen which acts similarly to 
    the default sms application.

==Caveats==
*Cannot reply to threads only Post new ones
*Cannot post to multiple groups
*Possibility of issues after changing settings while the service is running 
*Some of the buttons appear to be unresponsive this is caused by doing operations
    inside the UI thread and need to be wrapped in their own thread
