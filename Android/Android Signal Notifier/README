The code in st-signals is for Android devices 2.2 but should run on devices 1.5 and up.
If you want to test the could look for the .apk in the bin folder. This apk is not signed so you will need to enable "Unknown Sources" in your phones settings.

It can be installed using ADB or and application such as Astro File manager.

==Usage==
*Clicking on the application and enter configures and hitting ok runs the service in the background
*When a new signal is posted a notifcation will show
*Drag down the top bar and click on the notifcation
*This will open up the browser with the mobile version of the signals showing.

==Caveats==
*Uses the Push API but provides no real mechanism for syncronizing with the sequence number or timeouts.
*To stop service you need a task manager or go into settings and running services to stop.
*Does not use any API calls
*Assumes that all messages before the start of the service have already been viewed.
*Settings change on next poll 
*No settings for what signals you get. Any signal post after you start the service will be a notification.
*You need to login in to the web browser when it opens which potentially means you have to login everytime you get a notifcation unless you select remember me.
